I had a mock technical interview with SkilledInc. In preparation, I studed Algorithms and Data Structures. JavaScript was my chosen language for the interview. I spent about 8 to 12 hours preparing.

An experienced software engineer joined the virtual meeting at the appointed time. Initially, we talked a little, to break the ice and put me at ease. Discussion began about JavaScript, programming and comparisons to other languages. Then, the coding began. I was presented with a problem, then asked if I were familiar with such a problem. I was to then discuss and code the solution. There were prompts to discuss the efficiency of the solution, and other possible and/or better solutions. This was repeated three times. The assessment was respectfull, educational, and very beneficial.

I felt very comfortable with my interviewer, and really enjoyed the process. The hour was over very quickly. I was pleased with my score at the end, and I also gave a positive rating. Preparation can allay the nerves and butterflies. Just go with it, and have fun!
