To complete this project, I decided to scrape Car and Driver for the best rated cars of 2018. I'm not exactly a car lover, but I can appreciate a well-built automobile. Especially when it's also visually appealing.

Best Cars Cli:  https://github.com/Connieh1/best_cars

The requirements were that the application was to provide access to data from a web page, allowing the user to "make a choice and then get detailed information about their choice." This was to be done with a focus on object oriented programming. 

This CLI will give you a list of the 10 Best Cars of 2018 and prompt you to enter the number of the car you would like more information about. The automobile specifications will then be returned. You may then enter "y" to find out about another automobile or "n" to exit.

Despite having access to videos and sample CLI projects, I had a very hard time starting the project. A good deal of time was spent deciding on an idea, and then it didn't work out. The best site on the subject blocked nokogiri from opening it. Back to the drawing board.

Once I settled on Car and Driver's 10 Best Cars of 2018, the project began to take shape. While coding this CLI, I utilized two project support sessions, and reached out to a section lead. With the guidance, tips and help of those resources, I was able to get the project working.

Although it seemed really daunting, I think that I learned a lot from this project. I am excited to move forward in the 
Full-Stack Curriculum.
