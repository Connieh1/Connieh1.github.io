There are many theories and ideas about what it takes to learn a new skill, develop a new habit, or break and old habit. There's Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule to master a new skill.  Others say that 6 months is a good timeframe to learn a new skill. 28 days to develop a new habit. Replace a habit you want to break with a habit you want to develop, and you get the idea. There are many approaches to growth.

A very important factor in achieving a goal is to stick with it. Many times, life circumstances interfere with our goals and block our path. Those are the times when tenacity will save the day. You will need to step aside, and attend to whatever is most important at the time. Once that is handled, step back on the path, and keep moving forward. Your time-frame will be altered, and your plans changed or delayed. Keep sight of the goal, and continue on. You will be happy that you did when you are able to celebrate your achievements, large and small. Keep moving!
